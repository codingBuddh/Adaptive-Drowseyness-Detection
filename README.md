# Drowsiness Detection using Eye Aspect Ratio

This Python script detects drowsiness in real-time using the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) technique. It utilizes computer vision libraries such as OpenCV, dlib, and imutils to capture video from a webcam, detect faces, and calculate the eye aspect ratio to determine if the person's eyes are closed for an extended period, indicating drowsiness.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`opencv-python`)
- dlib
- imutils
- scipy

You can install the required libraries using pip:
